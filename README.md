# urlwatch
watch for status code changes in webpages and get notified in telegram

# Setup
Google on how to create a Telegram bot, then rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`, place your bot token and your user id there.

Add urls to watch in the array inside `watch.py`, you can set the delay for every check there too.
